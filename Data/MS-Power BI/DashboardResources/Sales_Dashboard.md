# Project based on creation of "Sales Dashboard"

✅ **Lookup/Dimension Tables and Data/Fact Tables:**
* Lookup Tables or Dimension Tables will have Primary Keys, will answer Who, What, Where, When and How <br>
* Data Tables or Fact Table will have Foreign Keys, and will contain transactional data <br>

* **Lookup/Dimenation Tables:** Customer (Who), Product (What), Territories (Where), Calendar (When and How) <br>
* **Data/Fact Tables:** Sales, Budget

✅ **Operations on Budget Workbook:** <br>
* Delete the promoted header <br>
* Delete first 3 null rows <br>
* Promote the first row as a header <br>
* Delete last total column <br>
* Filter out rows from the first column containing “Total” <br>
* Unpivot month columns labelled from Jan to Dec <br>
* Rename new created columns to Month and BudgetAmount <br>
* Change the data type of Month column to Date <br>
* Select close and apply <br>

✅ **Data Relationships for the Budget Project:** <br>
* Sales(CustomerKey) <- Customer(CustomerKey) <br>
* Sales(OrderDate) <- Calendar(Date) <br>
* Sales(ProductKey) <- Product(ProductKey) <br>
* Sales(SalesTerritoryKey) <- Territories(SalesTerritoryKey) <br>
* Budget(ProductKey) <- Product(ProductKey) <br>
* Budget(Month) <- Calendar(Date) <br>

✅ **Suggested DAX Formulaes for Creating Measures:** <br>
* MyBudget = SUM(Budget[BudgetAmount]) <br>
* MySales = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount]) <br>
* MyVariance = [MySales] - [MyBudget] <br>
* MyVariance% = DIVIDE([MyVariance], [MyBudget], 0) <br>
* MyComments = IF([MyVariance] < -100000, "Take Care", IF([MyVariance] < 0, "Not OK", "OK")) <br>

✅ **Suggested Tables Summaries (After filtering on Year 2016):** <br>
* **Table1:** Calendar[Year], Calendar[Month], Sum of Sales[SalesAmount] <br>
* **Table2:** Calendar[Year], Calendar[Month], Sum of Budget[BudgetAmount] <br>
* **Table3:** Territories[Country], Sum of Sales[SalesAmount] <br>
* **Table4:** Calendar[Year], Calendar[Month], Sum of Sales[SalesAmount], Sum of Budget[BudgetAmount] <br>
* **Table5:** Calendar[Year], Calendar[Month], Budget[MySales], Budget[MyBudget], Budget[MyVariance], Budget[MyVariance%], Budget[MyComment] <br>
